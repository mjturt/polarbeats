     unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions and any partially
     enforceable provision will, nevertheless, be binding and enforceable, and the Parties
     agree to substitute for the invalid provision a valid provision which most closely

A. Python

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com). In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

  Release             Derived        Year           Owner                GPL-

  2.1.3               2.1.2          2002           PSF                  yes
  2.2 and above       2.1.1          2001-now       PSF                   yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
   the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
   a modified version without making your changes open source. The
  CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
  is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or

this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely
link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work
and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the

Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-
free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer
to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
that You meet the following conditions:

    1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
       License; and
    2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed
       the files; and
    3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
       copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the
       Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works;
       and
    4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative
       Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
       contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
       part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
       text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
       generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
       appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
       modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
       that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
       provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
       License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
         provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

file.

responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and
assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
(including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
